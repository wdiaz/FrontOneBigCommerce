symfony server:start -d
./bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
./bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load

yarn install
yarn watch

note: the doctrine part is a hack. I find it easier handle the migrations part in symfony than using spring. A third repository might be needed but I don't have time for that rigth now.
